## Executive Summary

Work in progress.

### Overall Objective

The overall objective of this assignment is to conduct a comprehensive gender analysis of the plastic waste value chain in Chattogram City Corporation, Cox’s Bazar Municipality, and Tangail Municipality to identify gender-based disparities, barriers, and opportunities affecting women and marginalized groups. The study will examine gender roles, access to resources, decision-making, health and safety conditions, and the influence of intersecting factors such as age, disability, and socio-economic status. It will provide evidence-based insights to inform gender-responsive strategies that promote equitable participation, leadership, and empowerment across the plastic circularity ecosystem, ensuring that the transition to a circular economy is inclusive, fair, and beneficial to all. 

### Specific Objectives 

1. To map and document the distinct roles of women, men, and gender-diverse individuals in the waste collection, sorting, processing, and recycling segments of the plastics value chain.
2. Identify systemic barriers/vulnerabilities (social, health, economic, cultural) that limit women’s and marginalized genders’ full participation in the plastic’s circular economy.
3. Examine disparities in access to financial services, training, technology, equipment, and market opportunities among different gender groups.
4. Identify specific needs and priorities of women, men and people with different gender identities as well as highlight entry points for integrating gender equality and women’s empowerment into circular economy initiatives.
5. Recommend capacity building training/support can be provided to the beneficiaries specially for women & develop concept notes on different types of training /support activities.
6. Examine gender-specific health and safety risks (e.g., exposure to hazardous waste, workplace harassment) faced by workers and their family members in informal and formal waste sectors.
7. Identify gaps in existing policies and regulations related to the waste management value chain and recommend gender-inclusive reforms.
