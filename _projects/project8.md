## Executive Summary

**Background and Methods** 

A community-based cross-sectional survey was conducted by BISR Consultant Limited from December to January 2023 to review the performance of the GRESP project in The Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT). The current study evaluated the four components of GRESP: Education, Gender, Skill development, and Youth Participation. Program outcomes have been evaluated based on GRESP project indicators and some key questions as mentioned in ToR through quantitative surveys, classroom observation, Focus group discussion (FGD), In-depth interviews, and Key informant interviews (KII). School attendance and performance-related data were also collected from schools. OECD- DAC Evaluation Criteria was used as the framework for the entire evaluation. For the education component, 15 Government Primary Schools (GPS) and 15 Secondary Schools (SS) were selected randomly from the list of schools where BRAC interventions were implemented (called BRAC intervention schools). Among these 15 GPS, five schools included digital classrooms. For gender components, from the rest of the schools, 15 GPS and 20 SS were selected randomly targeting SWG and CWG members (in SS) and teachers who received gender training (GPS and SS). A comparable group was included in sampling. Ten schools (five GPS, five SS) were selected where BRAC interventions have not been implemented (called non-BRAC schools).
