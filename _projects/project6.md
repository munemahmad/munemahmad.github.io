## Executive Summary

The rapid expansion of Bangladesh's clothing industry has attracted rural families to urban centers such as Dhaka, where they become part of the Ready-Made Garment (RMG) workforce. These families, often nuclear and comprised of working couples, face challenges in accessing essential services and a secure environment. This report focuses on the children of RMG workers, who are particularly vulnerable due to inadequate access to healthcare, education, and child protection.

The primary objectives of the baseline survey were to assess the current protection status of children of garment workers and to identify obstacles they encounter in accessing care. The study aimed to understand the perspectives of various stakeholders, including families, communities, civil society organizations, government entities, and private sectors regarding child protection and exploitation issues. The survey was conducted in specific areas in Dhaka and Gazipur districts. Data were collected from 448 samples using a comprehensive research approach, including quantitative methods such as questionnaire surveys and qualitative methods like Focus Group Discussions (FGD), In-depth Interviews (IDI), and Key Informant Interviews (KII).

The baseline survey reveals a series of concerning findings: Firstly, the absence of Child Protection Groups or Forums in the surveyed areas is worrisome, as these are essential for safeguarding children's rights. Additionally, there is a lack of awareness initiatives involving children themselves, which deprives them of a platform to voice their concerns. The absence of Early Childhood Development (ECD) programs in both regions raises concerns about children's early learning and future prospects. Access to services in cases of abuse is limited, with Gazipur facing a dearth of NGO interventions, whereas Mirpur shows some promise with awareness-raising efforts. On a positive note, 15.5% of respondents expressed their participation in awareness campaigns, which could contribute to addressing child protection issues. Gazipur lacks child protection monitoring committees, while Mirpur's committee focuses on child trafficking and nutrition issues. Importantly, a significant proportion of RMG workers have accessed public or private services, potentially offering a means to address their needs. Finally, the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA) conducts training programs at various levels, reflecting industry-driven efforts for improvement. These findings underscore the urgency of addressing child protection and welfare issues within the RMG sector in Bangladesh.

The baseline survey highlights critical challenges in ensuring the rights and protection of children of RMG workers in Bangladesh. The absence of Child Protection Groups, limited awareness initiatives, and the lack of ECD programs underscore the need for immediate attention. Awareness campaigns, willingness to participate, and industry-driven initiatives offer some hope for improvement. It is crucial for stakeholders, including the government, NGOs, and the private sector, to collaborate and invest in child protection, education, and healthcare to break the cycle of poverty and exploitation faced by these vulnerable children.

This report serves as a foundation for designing targeted interventions and policies that prioritize the welfare and rights of children in the RMG sector and promote their holistic development.
