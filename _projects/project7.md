## Executive Summary

**Background and Context**

Rapid urbanization in Chattogram, Bangladesh's second-largest city (population share: 8.3% of the country), has led to significant depletion of urban green spaces, exacerbating environmental vulnerabilities such as urban heat islands, air quality deterioration, and water shortages. Historical data indicate a decline in green coverage from 68.34% in 1990 to 36.51% in 2020, primarily due to built-up area expansion (51.32 km² of green spaces converted). Recent studies (2023–2025) confirm ongoing land use/land cover (LULC) changes, with urban growth continuing to fragment green areas, though some reports note localized increases in coverage due to targeted interventions. Compared to Asian averages (38.6 m²/person), Chattogram lags, aligning with trends in other developing cities like Dhaka (shortage of 795 playgrounds) and Chattogram itself (shortage of 541). This study, commissioned by CCC, addresses these gaps by inventorying, assessing, and planning green spaces to enhance ecosystem services (regulatory, provisional, cultural, aesthetic) and support sustainable urban development, aligning with global standards (e.g., WHO: 9 m²/person) and national plans (e.g., Delta Plan 2100, SDGs).

**Objectives and Scope**

The primary objectives are: 
(1) Conduct a baseline assessment of playgrounds, vacant lands, and open green spaces in the CCC area; 
(2) Develop GIS-based maps for representative areas; and 
(3) Formulate a strategic development plan in model form for future site-specific designs. 

The scope includes inventorying all relevant spaces, baseline evaluations, GIS mapping, and strategic planning compliant with urban standards (e.g., size: min. 0.33 acres for playgrounds; accessibility: good connectivity; safety: no flood-prone areas). Deliverables comprise detailed inventories, GIS maps, and a strategic plan emphasizing conservation (e.g.,  percentage for preservation) and development (e.g., integration with master plans).

**Methodology**

This mixed-method study followed a phased approach over six months:

*Phase 1 (Desk Research & Inception):* Reviewed secondary literature (e.g., UN 2013, DAMRA 2017), project documents, and stakeholder inputs from CCC, CDA, Forest Department, DoE, NGOs, and universities.

*Phase 2 (Tools & Training):* Site visits for reconnaissance (social mapping, GPS demarcation using Garmin devices); grid finalization per ward plans; surveyor training (n= enumerators from BISR network) with pilot surveys.

*Phase 3 (Data Collection):* Topographic surveys (total station, GPS, geo-tagged photos) for attributes (e.g., fields, roads, green spaces); PRA methods (transect walks, KIIs with project professionals, government institutions, site managers).

*Phase 4 (Synthesis):* GIS database development (ArcGIS: points, lines, polygons, relational attributes); data analysis (SPSS, Excel); map preparation.

*Phase 5 (Strategic Planning):* Literature review (global/local policies); service identification via PRA; data acquisition (GIS/RS, EIA/SIA, economic analyses); plan preparation (conservation/development percentages, master plan compliance).

Economic analysis used BCR, NPV, and EIRR (SDR: 12%; CF: 0.85) with assumptions (e.g., O&M: 0.05% regular, 0.50% periodical; land price increase: 1%/year). Site selection criteria (Table 1 in report) covered size, flood-proneness, users, accessibility, safety, etc. Sample size: 17 sites (fields: 8, ponds: 3, roads: 3, parks/hills: 3) across CCC wards, selected via reconnaissance and stakeholder consultation.

**Key Findings**

*Green Space Dynamics:* Chattogram's green loss mirrors regional trends, driven by low-elevation/slope expansions. Recent data (2023–2024) highlight continued urbanization pressures, but mayor's initiatives (e.g., playgrounds/parks per ward) signal progress.

*Site-Specific Assessments:* Across 17 sites (e.g., Charchaktai School Field, Bahaddar Bari Pond, Batali Hill), designs emphasize drainage, walkways, seating, and management buildings.

*Social impacts:* Enhanced recreation, reduced youth risks (e.g., addiction); no resettlement needs, but eviction for encroachments (e.g., slums/shops). Environmental impacts: Minimal pollution/biodiversity risks; opportunities for hydrology improvements (e.g., waste management). Economic impacts: All sites viable (BCR 1.06–1.93; NPV positive; EIRR 12.48–17.99%>12% SDR); benefits from tourism (5% revenue increase), health savings (e.g., reduced chronic disease costs), and business growth (e.g., food carts adding Tk30,000/month revenue).

*Overall Rationale:* Projects promote well-being (e.g., mental health via green access), economic growth (e.g., investment attraction), sustainability (e.g., biodiversity corridors), and cohesion (e.g., inclusive spaces). Challenges: Political influences, pollution externalities; positives: High BCRs justify investments.

**Strategic Development Plan and Recommendations**

The plan prioritizes: Conservation (e.g.,  percentage of spaces preserved); development (e.g., integration with DAP/master plans); components (e.g., GIS maps for monitoring). 

**Recommendations:**

*Policy Alignment:* Enforce urban standards (e.g., 2.4 ha/1,000 residents per UK model); integrate NBS (e.g., green belts/wedges) per recent Bangladesh compendium (2025).

*Implementation:* Evacuate encroachments; enhance facilities (toilets, lighting, dustbins); promote co-management.

*Economic/Social*: Leverage multipliers (0.25); focus on health/tourism benefits.

*Monitoring:* Use GIS for spatio-temporal tracking; conduct EIAs/SIAs annually.

*Future:* Scale site-specific designs; address 541 playground shortages via mayor's plans.

**Conclusion**

This assessment underscores the urgency of green space revitalization in Chattogram amid urbanization (projected 70% global urban by 2050). With positive ECBA across sites and strategic planning, CCC can foster sustainable, livable urban environments, enhancing ecosystem services and resilience. Immediate action on 17 sites could serve as models, aligning with national/international goals for equitable green access. Total projected benefits outweigh costs, promising long-term value for Chattogram's 8.3% national population share.
