excerpt: 'This paper investigates the role of external financial means of implementation (MoI) in fostering economic growth in Bangladesh over the period 1990–2018. Specifically, it evaluates the individual contributions of exports, foreign direct investment (FDI), official development assistance (ODA), and remittances, as well as the comparative impact of total export earnings vis-à-vis the aggregate of other MoIs. Employing the ARDL bounds testing approach, the analysis identifies long-run cointegrating relationships among the variables. The results indicate that economic growth increases by 0.60, 0.06, and 0.38 units, respectively, for each unit increase in exports, FDI, and ODA, while remittances exert an insignificant negative effect owing to weak investment linkages and inappropriate consumption patterns. Overall, exports emerge as the most effective driver of growth, contributing 0.05% more than the combined impact of other MoIs. The robustness of these findings is confirmed through a series of diagnostic tests, underscoring the centrality of exports in Bangladesh’s growth trajectory.'

Sustainable development is the goal of every nation. For this reason, achieving rapid and continuous economic growth is imperative and steps should be taken to play a strong role by identifying and accelerating the performance of the areas that affect it the most. This paper explores the role of external financial means of implementation (MoI) in amplifying the economic growth of Bangladesh for the period 1990-2018. Two thoughts are specifically canvassed here: Sole contribution of export and each of the other MoI in achieving higher economic growth; total export earning or the aggregate amount of other MoI, which contribute the most. Co-integrating relations are determined by ARDL Bound test as variables are stationary at different level. In the long run, economic growth increase by 0.60, 0.06 and 0.38 units for every 1 unit of export, FDI and ODA increase. Money earned from remittances plays an insignificant negative role in GDP due to lack of investment and inappropriate consumption during that period. Export play the most effective role to boost economic growth as it contributes 0.05% more than aggregate value of other MoIs. The solidity of the results has been confirmed through various diagnostic tests.
