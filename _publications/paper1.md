Access to higher education shapes a country in a more productive and progressive way. For this reason, Bangladesh has experienced an increasing rate in the establishment of both Public Universities and Private Universities, like other developing countries. But maintaining quality of them is more concerned issue than embedding. So the aim of this study is to differentiate the current position of two major classes of university by their different determinants. In this study all existing public and private universities are used as sample. All the required data used in this study are secondary in nature. An explanatory-quantitative research method has been performed to reveal the assimilation between public and private universities. This study states that most of the determinants we have selected act positive with private universities rather than public universities.
