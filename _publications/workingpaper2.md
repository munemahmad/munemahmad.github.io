The creative industry has rapidly grown into a critical component of DKI Jakarta's economy. According to BPS data, it contributed approximately 7.28% to Indonesia's national GDP in 2017, with a total value of IDR 989.2 trillion. In DKI Jakarta, this sector accounted for 9.78% of the GRDP, amounting to IDR 256.5 trillion. Furthermore, Jakarta's creative industry plays a pivotal role in influencing and driving development in other regions across Indonesia. This study employs the Interregional Input-Output (IRIO) model and an Ordinary Least Square (OLS), utilizing regression analysis, to explore the strategic importance of the creative industry in DKI Jakarta and the key factors affecting its performance. The findings indicate that salaries/wages, employment levels, fixed capital (assets), fuel costs, and the proportion of imported raw materials significantly determine the industry's output and value-added growth. To foster the development of the creative industry, a comprehensive and integrated strategy is required. This includes ecosystem strengthening, human resource development, financial support and access to capital, market expansion and promotion, and diversification of raw material sources. The study offers crucial insights for policymakers and industry stakeholders to enhance the creative sector in both DKI Jakarta and Indonesia.
