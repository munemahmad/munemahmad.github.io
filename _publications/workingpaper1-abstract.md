## Abstract

This research explores the role of economic complexity in driving renewable energy consumption in selected South Asian countries. Using panel data of 4 South Asian countries (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka) from 1990 to 2021, we find a significant long-run relationship among the variables, establishing the interconnected dynamics within the energy sector. We estimate short-run and long-run effects using Pooled Mean Group (PMG) and Common Correlated Effect Pooled Mean Group (CCEPMG). Key findings demonstrate the positive impact of economic complexity on renewable energy consumption, emphasizing its role in transitioning economies toward sustainable practices through technological sophistication. Governments in South Asia should consider implementing targeted incentives for renewable energy infrastructures and research and development for complex economic sector, such as subsidies or tax breaks for foreign and domestic investors. Additionally, fostering trade agreements that prioritize clean energy technologies and reducing dependency on fossil fuels through gradual transition plans are essential steps.
